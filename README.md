# Portfolio
The development of my professional portfolio, developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails.

Current features:
- Top navbar with 'current page' highlighted
- Different images at the top of each page
- Responsivity
  - Mobile view vs. Desktop view: restructuring
- Bootstrap, completely customized

Planned extras:
- Github!
- Ruby on Rails integration to allow users to leave messages, deployed on Heroku
- CSV export
- Dynamic photo gallery using JavaScript on the "Photography" page

To do:
- Finish content for "Photography" and "Contact" pages
- The extras
- Check the top images on mobile to deal with shifting (especially on the "About" page... my face is cut out!)
- Make the photo page load quicker!!
