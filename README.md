# Portfolio
The development of my professional portfolio, developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails.

- Interactive homepage (blinking text, hover over "humans" and "computers" to see shaky text)
- Interactive JavaScript photo gallery on Photography page
- Posting Wall, developed with Ruby on Rails (link on "Projects" page)
- Facebook Login (link on "Projects" page)
- Contact form with email summary sent to my email
- Passes W3 validator and WAVE accessibility checker, and incredibly responsive! (try it out)
- Deployed in Google App Engine, programmed in Python. Utilizing Jinja2 templates to allow for a base + template structure

Extras:
- Extensive usage of GitHub for portfolio (https://github.com/bradymathieson/portfolio) and posting wall (https://github.com/bradymathieson/posting-wall)
- Custom domain name (http://bradymath.co vs. http://brady-portfolio-206.appspot.com)

- Facebook API Login and customized welcome message (login in the footer, message at top of homepage)
- Contact form with email notifications and form verification

I used the following resources:
- Animate.css (https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) to get the animation on the homepage
- Galleria (http://galleria.io) to make a JavaScript photo slideshow on my "photos" page
- Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) for the basic template, but it has been extensively changed
- Normalize.css (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to better consistency across browsers with HTML5
- RealWorld.css (http://visualidiot.com/articles/css3) to get blinking and shaky text effects
- jQuery (http://jquery.com) to program the collapsible navbar and other onLoad events
- Formspree (http://formspree.io) to help with email notifications on form submit
